## Obj extraction
There is a bug somewhere where it finds the correct planes with negative normals
Althoug it supposedly checks if this happens it does not really works.
There is now a workaround were it forces any negative normal (pointing down) to
positive (poiting upward).
Also all of this only works because it assumes poitn cloud is on the robot
base reference frame z: pointint to the roof, x pointing to the front and y
perperdicular to both.
Please if you are reading this just check why it finds negative normals...

### Update
Found the goddammen bug After performin pca a second time he forgot to check the
plane normal, now it does and i officially declare this damn bug squashed
And taksehi is happy
